## Different forms of gerunds and infinitives

1. She hates `being told` she should do more exercise.
   I'm tired of `being lied to`. I want the truth.
   It's not easy `to be liked` when you're the boss.
   These pills need `to be taken` after meals.

We use a passive gerund (`being done`) or a passive infinitive (`to be done`) to describe actions which _are done to the subject_.

2. He thanked them `for having helped` him.
   `Having studied` one language before makes it easier to learn another.
   How wonderful `to have finished` all our exams!
   By the time I'm 30, I hope to `have started` a family.

We use a perfect gerund (`having done`) or a perfect infinitive (`to have done`) if we want to emphasize that an _action is completed or in the past_.
Often there is no difference between using a simple gerund or infinitive and a perfect gerund or infinitive, e.g.
He denied stealing / having stolen the money.
It was our fault. We were silly not to lock / not to have locked the car.

3. I would like `to have seen` your face when they told you you'd won the competition!
   We would rather `have stayed` in a more central hotel, but they were all full.

We use the perfect infinitive after `would like, would love, would hate, would prefer, and would rather to talk about` an earlier action. Compare:
I would like to see the Eiffel Tower. (= when I go to Paris in the future)
I would like to have seen the Eiffel Tower. (= I was in Paris, but I didn't see it)

4. I'd like `to be lying` on the beach right now.
   She seems `to be coughing` a lot do you think she's OK?

We use a continuous infinitive (`to be + verb + -ing`) to say that an action / event is in progress _around the time we are talking about_.

## Other uses of gerunds and infinitives

1 `It's no use worrying`. There's nothing you can do.
`Is there any point (in) asking` Mark? He never has anything useful to say.
`It's no good talking` to my sister, because she doesn't listen to me.

We use the gerund after certain expressions with it or there, e.g. It's no use, There's no point, It's no good, etc.

2 We had `an agreement to share` the costs.

We use the infinitive with to: after nouns formed from verbs which take the infinitive, e.g. agree, plan, hope, etc.

3 Our `plan` is `to leave` on Saturday. You can't visit the Louvre in a day there's `too much to see`.
There wasn't `enough` snow `for us to ski`.

after expressions with quantifiers, e.g. enough, too much, a lot, plenty of, etc.
When we want to refer to the subject of the infinitive verb we use for + person or object pronoun before the infinitive. This can be used before any infinitive structure, e.g. after adjectives: It's very difficult for me to decide.

4 Is there `anything to eat`?
There's `nowhere to go` at night.

after something, anywhere, etc.

5 I don't know `where to go` or `what to do`.

after question words (except why).

6 He's the `youngest` player ever `to play` for England.

after superlatives and first, second, last, etc., e.g. Who was the first person to walk on the moon?

## And + verb

We often use `and + verb` instead of `to + infinitive` after try, wait, come, and go, e.g. Come and see me when you're next in New York.
I'm not sure what's going to happen - we need to wait and see.
