# Permission, obligation, and necessity

## can/could, must, should, ought to, had better

1 `Can` I use your phone, as my battery seems to have died?
I `couldn't` take any photos in the gallery, so I bought some postcards.
If you want to apply for this job, you `must` be able to speak Spanish.
We `should/ought` to drive-it'll be much quicker.

The most common modal verbs for talking about permission and obligation are `can/could, must, and should/ought to`.
We can also use May 17 to ask for permission, ag. May l use your phone?
Should you can take it as an advice

2 We `should have/ ought` to have driven it would have been quicker.
We can use `should have` or `ought to have past participle` to talk about past events which did not happen and which we regret.

3 You'`d better` post the parcels today or they won't get there in time.

`had better` is stronger and more urgent than `should/ ought` to and is often used to give strong advice or a warning. It normally refers to the immediate future

The negative is `had better not` NOT hadn't-better

## mustn't/don't have to

You `mustn't` take photos during the performance
You `don't have` to tip here unless you think the service was especially good

mustn't and don't have to are completely different. - `mustn't` is used to express an obligation not to do something. - `don't/doesn't have` to is used to express an absence of obligation.

## need

1 You usually `need to check` in at least two hours before a flight leaves.
You `don't need` to take a jacket. It's going to be hot today.

We use `need/don't need to + infinitive` to say that something is necessary/unnecessary. You can use these forms for habitual, general, and specific necessity.

2. We `needn't` lock the car, Nobody will steal it in this village.
   When we want to say that something is unnecessary on a specific occasion, we can also use `needn't + infinitive without to`.

3 We `needn't have booked/didn't need to book`. The restaurant is empty!
When something was not necessary, but you did it, you can use wither `needn't have past participle` or `didn't need to infinitive`.

4 We knew the way, so we `didn't need to use` the satnav.
When something was not necessary, so you did not do it, you must use didn't need to. Compare:
We didn't need to book. It wasn't necessary. We may have booked or we may not.)
We needn't have booked. ( We booked, but it wasn't necessary.)

## be able to, be allowed to, be permitted to, be supposed / meant to

1 From tomorrow we `won't be able` to park in this street.
You're not `allowed/permitted to` smoke in any public buildings in our country.

We often use person `be able to` or `be allowed + to infinitive` instead of `can` to talk about what is possible or permitted.

2 it `is not permitted to` take phones into the exam room.
`it be permitted to + infinitive` is used in formal situations, eg. notices and announcements, to say what can/can't be done according to the law or to rules and regulations.
We don't use it isn't allowed to NOT allowed to take phones into the them room

3 We `are supposed/meant to` check out by 12.00. What's the time now?
You `aren't supposed/meant to` park here-it's reserved for teachers.

We can also use be `supposed to/be meant to + infinitive` to say what people should or shoulde't do, often because of rules. There is often a suggestion that the rules are not necessarily obeyed, e.g. Students are not supposed/meant to have guests after 12:00, but everyone does
