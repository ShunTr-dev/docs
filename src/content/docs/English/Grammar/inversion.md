title: Inversion
---

_N -> AUX -> sub/V_

In formal English, especially in writing, we sometimes change the normal word order to make the sentence more emphatic or dramatic.

1 `Not only is the plot great`, (but) it's also very well written.
Not until you can behave like an adult `will we treat` you like an adult.
`Never have I heard` such a ridiculous argument.
`Never again` will I believe a word he says.
`No sooner had the football match started` than it began to snow heavily.

This structure is common with negative adverbial expressions such as Not only..., Not until..., Never (again)..., and No sooner... (a formal way of saying as soon as).
When we use inversion after the above expressions, we change the order of the subject and (auxiliary) verb. NOT Not only the plot is great....

Compare:

I have never heard such a ridiculous argument. (= normal word order)
Never have I heard such a ridiculous argument. (= inversion to make the sentence more emphatic)

2 `Not only did you forget` to shut the window, (but) you also forgot to lock the door!
`Not until` you become a parent yourself `do you understand` what it really means.
In the present simple and past simple tense, rather than simply inverting the subject and verb, we use do / does / did + subject + main verb. NOT Not only forgot you to shut the window...

3 The train began to move. `Only then was I able to` relax.
`Only when` you leave home `do you realize` how expensive everything is.
`Hardly had I sat down when / before` the meeting began.
`Rarely have I met` a more irritating person.

Inversion is also used after the expressions Only then..., Only when..., Hardly / Scarcely..., Rarely...

## Overuse of inversion

Inversion should only be used occasionally for dramatic effect.
Overusing it will make your English soundÂ unnatural.
