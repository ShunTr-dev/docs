Introduction
This is an introduction

_Arguments in favour_

Perhaps the greatest benefit of smartphones is that they allow us to access an incredible amount of information. They are not just phones - we can also use them as maps, encyclopaedias, novels, entertainment systems, and much more. We live in an age of information, and smartphones help us to make the most of it all. In addition, they allow us to live our lives spontaneously. Whether you need a taxi, have to book a restaurant table, or want to identify stars in the night sky, you can do it straight away. Finally, they keep us in touch with our friends and family, and the social role they play in a fast-moving society is hugely important.

_Arguments against_

However, there are strong arguments to suggest that what appear to be the advantages of smartphones can also have downsides. One drawback is the cost - monthly contracts are far from cheap and smartphones tend to become obsolete quickly, so people feel they need to buy the latest model. What is more, they are a constant distraction, as they encourage people to spend hours checking social networking sites when they could be doing something more useful. But perhaps the most significant downside is for working people. On the one hand, smartphones offer great convenience, but they also mean that employees can be contacted by their boss or by customers at any time, even while they are on holiday.
