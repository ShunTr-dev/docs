## 🧠 What is written mediation?

**Written mediation** is when you read a text in English and **explain its content to someone else**, adapting the message to their **level, background, or needs**.  
⚠️ It's _not_ about translating word-for-word — it’s about **reorganizing and reformulating the information** in your own words.

## 🎯 Goal of written mediation

> To clearly and effectively **communicate the relevant ideas** from a text, adapting them to **suit the target audience**.

---

## ✍️ Step-by-step strategy

1. **Read the original text carefully**  
   ➤ Identify the main idea clearly. (numbers, source, country...).

2. **Use your own words**  
   ➤ Explain the (most relevants) details.

3. **Organize the information logically**  
   ➤ Group similar ideas, highlight contrasts or trends, and avoid repeating things unnecessarily.

4. **Be clear, concise, and objective**  
   ➤ Prioritize what matters — don’t include every detail, just the relevant ones.

5. **Not all the percentages has to be transformed in quarters**

## 🎯 Tips and Tricks

✨ **Rephrasing numbers and stats**

-   37% → “about a third”
-   73% → “almost three-quarters”
-   Not every number needs to be changed — focus on what’s clearest.

✨ **Include the source**

-   “According to a 2023 report by the _Pew Research Center_...”
-   “A survey carried out by _YouGov_ shows that...”

✨ **Group and interpret data**

-   Group: “Altogether, over 60% of participants said...”
-   Interpret: “This suggests a clear trend towards...”

## 🟢 **How to Start**

Begin by **setting the context** of the original text. Mention where the information comes from and what the topic is about — this helps your reader understand the background.

### Useful openers:

-   “The article discusses…”
-   “According to a recent study by [source]...”
-   “This report focuses on…”
-   “Considering this, I'm going to explain…”
-   “Here's a quick summary of what the text says about…”
-   “The main idea of the article is that…”

### Example:

> “According to a 2024 survey by Pew Research Center, most young adults in the US are concerned about climate change. The article explains how this affects their daily choices.”

## 🔴 **How to Conclude**

Wrap things up by **summarizing the main takeaway**, or **offering a closing idea** that makes the message clear. If the mediation is meant to be informal or personal, you can also **express a reaction**.

### Useful closing lines:

-   “In short, the text highlights…”
-   “To sum up, it shows that…”
-   “The author believes this will lead to…”
-   “That’s the main idea behind the article.”
-   “So, basically, it means that…”
-   “It seems like this trend will continue in the future.”

### Example:

> “To sum up, the article shows that technology is becoming essential in healthcare, and the author is optimistic about its future role.”
