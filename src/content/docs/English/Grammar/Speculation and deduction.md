# Speculation and deduction

modal verbs: must, may, might, can't, could, should, ought

1. That _must be_ an electric car it isn't making any noise at all.
   You _must have seen_ him he was standing right in front of you!

2. They _can't be_ playing very well-they're losing 3-0.
   You _can't/couldn't have spent_ very long on this essay you've only written 100 words.

3. I haven't seen the Sales Manager today. He _may/might/could be_ off sick.
   The keys of the store cupboard have disappeared. Do you think someone _may/might/could have taken_ them?
   He _may / might not have heard_ the message | left.

4. If I post the letter today, it _should / ought to arrive_ on Friday.
   I posted the letter a week ago, it _should/ ought to have arrived_ by now.

1 As well as using `must` for obligation, we also use `must + infinitive` to say that we are almost sure something is true about the present and `must have + past participle` to say that we are almost sure something was true or happened in the past.

2 We use `can't + infinitive` to say that we are almost sure that something isn't true in the present and `can't have / couldn't have + past participle` to say that we are almost sure that something wasn't true / didn't happen in the past.

We don't use `mustn't/ mustn't` have with this meaning.

3 We use `may / might / could + infinitive and may have / might have / could have + past participle` to say that we think it's possible that something is true in the present, or was true / happened in the past. We only use may not or might not to talk about a negative possibility. _NOT couldn't_

4 We use `should/ ought to + infinitive` to describe a situation we expect to happen. We use `should have / ought to have + past participle` to describe a situation we would expect to have happened in the past.

### Infinitive or continuous infinitive after modals?

He must work really hard. He never gets home before 9.00 p.m.
(= deduction about a habitual action)
There's a light on in his office. He must still be working. (= deduction about an action in progress at the moment of speaking)

## Adjectives and adverbs for speculation

1 He'`s bound / sure to` be here in a minute. He left an hour ago. She'`s bound/sure to` know. She's an expert on the subject.
Bound and sure are adjectives. We use `be bound` or `be sure + to + infinitive` to say that we think something is certain to be true or to happen.

2 I think she's `likely / unlikely` to agree to our proposal. It is `likely / unlikely` that the government will raise interest rates this year.

`Likely / unlikely` are also adjectives (not adverbs). We can use `subject + be likely` / `unlikely + to + infinitive`, or it is `likely / unlikely + that + clause`.

3 She'`ll definitely pass` the exam. She's worked really hard.
She `definitely won't` pass the exam. She hasn't done any work at all.
He'`ll probably be` here around 8.00. He usually leaves work at 7.30.
He `probably won't` be here until about 8.15. He's stuck in a traffic jam.

    `Definitely` and `probably` are adverbs. They *go before a main verb* and *after the auxiliary* if there is one in + sentences and before the auxiliary in sentences.
    With `be` they go after the `verb in + sentences` and before the verb sentences, e.g. He's probably British. The painting definitely isn't genuine.
