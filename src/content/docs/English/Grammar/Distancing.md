# distancing

seem/appear

1. `It seems/appears that` when older people stay busy, they are in fact much healthier.
   The new Head of Department `seems/appears to be` quite friendly
   Excuse me. There `seems/appears` to be a mistake with the bill

We often use `seem` and `appear` to give information without stating that we definitely know it is true, in this way distancing ourselves from the information.
We can use it `seems/appears that + clause`, or subject `seem/appear + infinitive`.

2. It would `seem/appear` that Mr Young had been using the company's assets to pay off his private debts.
   We use it would `seem/appear` that clause to distance ourselves even further from the information, making it sound even less sure. This is more formal than it `seems/appears`.

## The passive with verbs of saying and reporting

Another way of distancing ourselves from the facts, especially in formal written English, is to use the passive form of verbs like say, think, etc. to introduce them.

1 `It is said` that using a washing machine saves people on average 47 minutes a day.
`It has been announced` by a spokesperson `that` the President has been taken to hospital.

It + passive verb + that + clause.
Verbs commonly used in this pattern are: agree, announce, believe claim, expect, hope, say, suggest, and think,

2 The company director `is expected to resign` in the next few days.
The missing couple `are understood to have been` living in Panama for the last five years

subject + passive verb + to + infinitive.
Verbs commonly used in this pattern are: believe, consider, expect, report, say, think, and understand.

3 There `are thought to be` over a thousand species in danger of extinction.

There can also be used + passive verb+to+ infinitive. Compare:
`It is said that there are` more than five million people living in poverty in this country.
`There are said to be` more than five million people living in poverty in this country.

## Other distancing expressions: apparently, according to, may/might, claim

1 Apparently, Jeff and Katie have separated.

We use apparently (usually either at the beginning or the end of a phrase) to mean that we have heard/read something, but that it may not be true. This is very common in informal conversation.

2 According to new research, the idea that we have to drink two litres of water a day is a myth.

We use according to to specify where information has come from. We use it to attribute opinions to somebody else. NOT According to me

3 Dinosaurs may have died out due to extremely rapid climate change. There are rumours that the band, who broke up ten years ago. might be planning to reform and record a new album.

Using may/might also suggests that something is a possibility, but not necessarily true.

4 The health minister claims to have reduced waiting times.

We can say that somebody claims something when there is some doubt about whether it is true.
