# Quality criteria for a good mediation

1. Identify the main idea clearly. (Source + demographics + country)
2. Explain the (most relevants) details.
3. Adapt the language (stay DRY) Change the words
4. Be objective
5. Not all the percentages has to be transformed in quarters

-> reformulation of the numbers: 37% => 1/3
-> (more) complex language
-> Source (Pew Research centre)
-> Respondents/ demographics specific info
-> Grouping data + elaborating data
