# The past: habitual events and specific incidents

## Narrative tenses: describing specific incidents in the past

This _happened_ when I _was_ about five years old. My father _had gone away_ on business for a few days and my brother and I _were sleeping_ in my parents' bedroom. Before we _went_ to bed that night, I _had been reading_ a very scary story about a wicked witch. In the middle of the night, I _woke up_ with a start and _saw_ that a figure in a dark coat _was standing_ in the doorway. I _screamed_ at the top of my voice.

When we describe specific incidents in the past, we use _narrative tenses_, i.e. the past simple, past continuous, and past perfect simple or continuous - We use the past simple to talk about the _main actions in a story_ (We went to bed. .., I woke up. I screamed). - We use the past continuous to _set the scene_ (We were sleeping in my parents' bedroom) and to describe actions in progress in the past (Somebody was standing in the doorway). - We use the past perfect and the past perfect continuous to _talk about the earlier past_, i.e. things which happened before the main event (My father had gone away.... I had been reading a story).

## _used to_ and _would_: describing habitual events and repeated actions in the past

1.  Every summer, my family _used to rent_ an old house in the south of France. My sister and I _often walked_ to the harbour in the morning, where we _used to watch_ the fishermen cleaning their nets.
2.  Every night before we went to bed, my mother _would tell_ US stories, but she _would never read_ them from a book - she _would always make them up_ herself.
3.  When I was a teenager, my friends _were always teasing_ me because of my red hair.

4.  We often use `used to + infinitive` as an alternative to the past simple to talk about things that we _did repeatedly_ in the past.

    -   We can also `use used to + infinitive` to talk about situations or states which have changed, e.g. I used to have much longer hair when I was younger.

5.  We use `would + infinitive` as an alternative to used to to talk about things that we did repeatedly in the past over a period of time.

    -   We _don't_ use would with stative verbs, i.e. to talk about situations or states which have changed. NOT I-would-have-much-longer-hair- when-I-was-younger.
    -   We _don't_ use would without a time reference, e.g. I used to play the violin. NOT I-would-play-the violin.

6.  We can also use `always + past` continuous for things that happened repeatedly, especially when they were irritating habits.

`used to and be / get used to` Be careful not to confuse `used to and be / get used to`. used to only describes states or repeated actions in the past, be / get used to means be fget familiar with, e.g We used to live in London. We moved to the country last year, but we re still not used to it It's too quret for me, and my husband can't get used to having to driveÂ everywhere.
